A public repo to compile and track the programs I write in C,I guess the question I'm really trying to ask is why do I find C so good to code in? Is it merely the raw power and flexibility of the memory management? Is it the increased difficulty that keeps things fresh? Is it the switch to a classless paradigm? Or is it some other intangible means?
