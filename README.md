## 🎯 What's PROGRAMMING IN C ? 🎯

Its just a public repo to compile and track the programs I write in C as a CSE UnderGrad trying to improve my programing fundamentals and improve analytical and reasoning skills.

## 🤔 Why code in C ? 🤔

👉 The biggest advantage of C over C++: simplicity. A programmer can understand the whole C language and have a complete mental model in the head, while no such C++ programmer exists, not even Stroustrup.

👉 C is very fast in terms of execution time.
Programs written and compiled in C execute much faster than compared to any other programming language. C programming language is very fast in terms of execution as it does not have any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks
